    "bodyText": "It was an emotional and engaging episode of The Lunchroom this week as host GrandPrince Ita sat down with the creative team behind the highly anticipated film, The Fisherman.\nFilmmaker Director Zoe was joined by actors Endurance Grand, Rick Ade Layitar, and William Lamptey for a conversation that delved into the film’s message, the emotional toll of storytelling, and the cultural bond that unites the cast, ending, of course, with the lighthearted Nigeria vs. Ghana Jollof rice debate.\nDirector Zoe clarified that despite its title, The Fisherman is not a story about the sea but about dreams, resilience, and the pursuit of purpose against all odds.\n“Forget the hook and line,” she said. “This film is pure heart, a testament to resilience, the power of a dream, and the enduring human spirit. Every character is fighting for something bigger than themselves.”\nFor Endurance Grand, taking on her first major leading role was both challenging and transformative. She described the process as “intensely demanding but deeply rewarding,” crediting the film for pushing her to discover new emotional depths as an actor.\nHer co-star Rick Ade Layitar shared a deeply personal story that touched everyone in the studio. The actor revealed he was dealing with the loss of his brother when he joined the project, and that the experience became a crucial part of his healing journey.\n“Acting in The Fisherman was therapy for me,” he admitted. “It allowed me to channel my grief into something meaningful and find peace through the character.”\nThe discussion also took a lighter turn when William Lamptey, who is visiting Nigeria for the first time, praised the country’s “overwhelming energy, infectious creativity, and incredible warmth.”\nNaturally, the conversation soon drifted to the long-standing culinary rivalry between Nigeria and Ghana. With Endurance Grand being of both Nigerian and Ghanaian heritage, she found herself hilariously stuck in the middle as her co-stars playfully defended their countries’ versions of Jollof rice.\nWrapping up the conversation, Director Zoe encouraged audiences to experience the story for themselves, describing The Fisherman as a film that will inspire viewers to never give up on their dreams.",

The result is something that respects our roots but is impossible to sit still to.”\nThe track, she explained, merges the layered percussion of traditional Fuji music with the vibrant, rhythmic pulse of House creating a sound that’s as energetic as it is culturally grounded.\nBeyond the music, Omawumi used her time on Base FM to speak passionately about unity among female artists in the Nigerian music industry.\n“Growth in this industry, especially for women, depends on us,” she said. “We need to intentionally uplift one another — share knowledge, share stages, and share the spotlight. That genuine support is what drives collective success.”\nWrapping up the conversation, Omawumi teased that “Temperature” marks the beginning of an exciting new chapter in her career. She confirmed that more releases are on the way in January, promising to keep exploring fresh sounds and creative risks.",

    "summary": "On Base Sunrise with Chacha, veteran journalist Segun James joined the conversation to reflect on the harsh realities of practicing journalism in Nigeria, a country where, as he put it, “the lives of journalists are not valued.”",
    "bodyText": "As the world marked the International Day to End Impunity for Crimes Against Journalists, Segun shared deeply personal experiences that shed light on the dangers, lack of protection, and emotional toll faced by those in the media profession.\nSegun emphasized that the root of the crisis lies in impunity, the consistent failure to hold perpetrators accountable for violence against journalists.\n“The major reason these attacks persist,” he noted, “is because those responsible are never investigated or punished.”\nBoth international and local media watchdogs have long confirmed this disturbing trend: in nearly all cases of journalist killings, harassment, or intimidation in Nigeria, justice is never served. This entrenched culture of impunity, Segun warned, emboldens aggressors and silences truth-tellers.\nBeyond the physical threats, the journalist spoke about the psychological burden of working under constant danger. He described how this climate of fear has created a “chilling effect” where journalists are forced into self-censorship to avoid detention, harm, or even death.\n“When your personal safety is at stake,” he explained, “you begin to question whether reporting the truth is worth the risk. And when that happens, the public suffers—because a less-informed public means a weaker democracy.”\nSegun James also recounted harrowing personal experiences from the field—including witnessing a colleague’s assassination while on duty and facing physical violence after publishing a story about a state governor.\n“The governor called me a ‘terrorist journalist’ just because I wrote the truth,” he recalled. “He didn’t even bother to report me to my organization because he knew the facts were correct.”\nHe went on to reveal that such confrontations have forced him to tone down his reporting and avoid certain assignments, not out of fear of exposure, but simply to stay alive.\nSegun further highlighted the economic struggles many Nigerian journalists face, stressing that poor pay and lack of insurance or institutional protection make an already risky job even more dangerous.\nHost Chacha echoed his sentiments, reminding listeners that journalism is more than a profession; it is a public service.\n“Journalism isn’t just a job,” she said. “It’s a social service that holds power accountable and keeps society informed.” Segun agreed, adding that while the tools of journalism have evolved from fax machines to laptops and mobile phones, the most urgent transformation must happen in education.\n“Not everyone sharing information online is a journalist,” he cautioned. “There’s a thin line between citizen reporting and professional journalism, and that line is fading fast. We need education and regulation to preserve the credibility of the profession.”\nAs the conversation closed, both Segun and Chacha called for stronger laws to protect journalists and hold attackers accountable. Their discussion served as a sobering reminder that without safety, fairness, and freedom for the press, democracy itself remains under threat.\n",

    "bodyText": "A British court has ruled that a 14-year-old boy who sued his parents after being sent to boarding school in Ghana must remain there until he completes the equivalent of his GCSEs.\n\nThe teenager, who cannot be identified for legal reasons, was taken to Ghana in March 2024 under the pretext of visiting a sick relative. However, court documents reveal his parents had planned the move over concerns about his behaviour in London, citing frequent absences from school, unexplained money, and possession of a knife. The boy denies carrying a weapon or being involved in gang activity.\n\nIn a judgment delivered on Tuesday, Mrs Justice Theis of the High Court ruled that the boy should continue his studies in Ghana, despite his wish to return to the United Kingdom. She said: “I am acutely aware that the conclusion I have reached does not accord with [his] wishes and how that will feel for him. [He] has the talent, ability and intelligence to make this work together with his family. It will be difficult but they all have the common aim for [him] to return to live with his family.”\n\nThe decision marks the latest development in a case that began when the boy, feeling “unhappy and homesick”, contacted publicly funded lawyers and filed a case against his parents in February 2025. He initially lost the case after the High Court ruled that returning to the UK would expose him to “greater harm”. However, the Court of Appeal ordered a rehearing in June after Sir Andrew McFarlane, President of the Family Division, found that the earlier ruling contained procedural confusion.\n\nThe boy, who holds both British and Ghanaian citizenship, told the court he felt “like an alien” in Ghana and described his experience as “living in hell”. He said he had struggled to make friends, did not speak Twi, and suffered from social anxiety.\n\nHis solicitor, James Netto of the International Family Law Group, said his client “welcomes” the judge’s decision to provide a “road map” for his eventual return but maintained that “his position remains unchanged: he wants to return home”. Mr Netto added that the case had been “extremely difficult on every level” and that the boy had not wanted to take legal action against his parents but had “no meaningful alternative”.\n\nThe boy’s mother told the court she still feared for her son’s safety if he were to return to the UK prematurely. “It is really hard to be away from him,” she said. “I feared and continue to fear if he were to come back now, that he could end up dead. I know he does not see it like that.”\n\nMrs Justice Theis ordered that the teenager “remain living in Ghana with the aim of setting out a road map and taking the necessary steps for [him] to return here after completing his GCSEs”, adding that his situation “will need to be reviewed nearer the time”.\n\nThe roadmap includes ongoing family therapy funded by the local authority, intended to support the boy’s eventual reintegration into life in the United Kingdom.",

He’s been on medication ever since.\n\n“I still have crises,” he said. “When we talk about a crisis, it’s pain in your joints, your legs, and sometimes your stomach.

He credits better self-care and access to treatment for keeping things under control.The 38-year-old artist also addressed rumours that he did a bone marrow transplant to ‘cure’ it. He denied that and said people on the internet talk “with so much confidence about what they don’t know.”\n\nBeyond talking about his own story, Adekunle Gold used the moment to push awareness.

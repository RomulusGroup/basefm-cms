    "bodyText": "A British court has ruled that a 14-year-old boy who sued his parents after being sent to boarding school in Ghana must remain there until he completes the equivalent of his GCSEs.\n\nThe teenager, who cannot be identified for legal reasons, was taken to Ghana in March 2024 under the pretext of visiting a sick relative. However, court documents reveal his parents had planned the move over concerns about his behaviour in London, citing frequent absences from school, unexplained money, and possession of a knife. The boy denies carrying a weapon or being involved in gang activity.\n\nIn a judgment delivered on Tuesday, Mrs Justice Theis of the High Court ruled that the boy should continue his studies in Ghana, despite his wish to return to the United Kingdom. She said: “I am acutely aware that the conclusion I have reached does not accord with [his] wishes and how that will feel for him. [He] has the talent, ability and intelligence to make this work together with his family. It will be difficult but they all have the common aim for [him] to return to live with his family.”\n\nThe decision marks the latest development in a case that began when the boy, feeling “unhappy and homesick”, contacted publicly funded lawyers and filed a case against his parents in February 2025. He initially lost the case after the High Court ruled that returning to the UK would expose him to “greater harm”. However, the Court of Appeal ordered a rehearing in June after Sir Andrew McFarlane, President of the Family Division, found that the earlier ruling contained procedural confusion.\n\nThe boy, who holds both British and Ghanaian citizenship, told the court he felt “like an alien” in Ghana and described his experience as “living in hell”. He said he had struggled to make friends, did not speak Twi, and suffered from social anxiety.\n\nHis solicitor, James Netto of the International Family Law Group, said his client “welcomes” the judge’s decision to provide a “road map” for his eventual return but maintained that “his position remains unchanged: he wants to return home”. Mr Netto added that the case had been “extremely difficult on every level” and that the boy had not wanted to take legal action against his parents but had “no meaningful alternative”.\n\nThe boy’s mother told the court she still feared for her son’s safety if he were to return to the UK prematurely. “It is really hard to be away from him,” she said. “I feared and continue to fear if he were to come back now, that he could end up dead. I know he does not see it like that.”\n\nMrs Justice Theis ordered that the teenager “remain living in Ghana with the aim of setting out a road map and taking the necessary steps for [him] to return here after completing his GCSEs”, adding that his situation “will need to be reviewed nearer the time”.\n\nThe roadmap includes ongoing family therapy funded by the local authority, intended to support the boy’s eventual reintegration into life in the United Kingdom.",

I want a peaceful, free and fair election. This election is for Ndi-Anambra, and anyone who wins, wins for the development of the state.\n\n“All the contestants, including the incumbent governor, Prof. Chukwuma Soludo of the All Progressives Grand Alliance, Prince Nicholas Ukachukwu of the All Progressives Congress and my party’s candidate, Chief George Moughalu of the Labour Party, are my friends.\n\n“But I will vote for the candidate of my party, and I urged every other voter-card-carrying resident in Anambra State to go out and vote for the candidate of their choice.”\n\nObi, however, called on the Independent National Electoral Commission and security agencies to uphold their constitutional responsibilities by ensuring neutrality and professionalism during the electoral exercise.\n\nPunch Online had reported that the INEC had declared full readiness for the governorship election slated for Saturday, November 8, 2025, across the 5,718 wards across the state.\n\nThe Chairman of the commission, Prof. Joash Amupitan, during a stakeholders meeting in Awka, said about 24,000 ad hoc staff will be deployed, while about 540 journalists have been accredited to cover the election, adding that the commission is fully committed to the governorship poll in line with its commitment to credible and inclusive elections.\n\nHe said the Commission has been implementing a comprehensive plan of activities covering logistics, technology, training, stakeholder engagement, and security coordination, including the conduct of a mock accreditation exercise, which was conducted across selected polling units in three senatorial districts of the state on Saturday.\n\nAccording to INEC, 16 candidates from 16 political parties are contesting the governorship election to wrest power from the incumbent, Prof. Chukwuma Soludo, who is also seeking reelection under the platform of APGA.",

    "bodyText": "Armed bandits raided the Farin Dutse community in Kauru Local Government Area of Kaduna State and killed a local pastor, Rev. Yahaya Kambasiya, during a night attack that also left more than 20 residents abducted.\n\nRev. Kambasiya was a minister with the United Church of Christ in Nigeria (HEKAN). According to witnesses, the attackers moved into the village shooting, forcing families out of their homes, and targeting members of the church community. He was shot and killed at the scene.\n\nAfter killing the pastor, the gunmen went house to house and took several people, including women and youths, before escaping with them into nearby bush areas.\n\nThe President of HEKAN, Rev. Dr. Amos Kiri, condemned the attack and described it as “an attack on a peaceful worship community.” He called the killing of Rev. Kambasiya “painful and unacceptable,” and demanded immediate action from security agencies to rescue the abducted members and stop repeated raids on Christian communities in that part of Kaduna.\n\nHe also urged authorities at both state and federal level to stop treating these incidents as routine and to treat them as an ongoing emergency affecting worship centres, pastors, and entire families.\n\nResidents of the area say this is not the first time armed groups have entered at night, taken hostages, and left without resistance. Locals say they feel abandoned and unprotected, and that kidnappings for ransom have become a way of life in rural Kaduna.\n\nAs of now, the abducted worshippers are still missing.",

    "summary": "Nigerian singer Adekunle Gold says he is still living with sickle cell disease and still goes through painful “crises,” a condition he’s managed since he was five years old. He urged Nigerians to know their genotype before marriage so they don’t pass the disorder to their children, saying “a lot of people still don’t understand the risk",
    "bodyText": "Adekunle Gold has opened up about his ongoing battle with sickle cell disease, saying he still experiences painful health crises even as an adult.\n\nAccording to him, his first major crisis happened when he was about five years old. He said his mum had to carry him on her back to the hospital in the middle of the night while his dad wasn’t home. He’s been on medication ever since.\n\n“I still have crises,” he said. “When we talk about a crisis, it’s pain in your joints, your legs, and sometimes your stomach. It’s really crazy.” He added that while the attacks are now less frequent than when he was younger, they haven’t fully gone away. He credits better self-care and access to treatment for keeping things under control.The 38-year-old artist also addressed rumours that he did a bone marrow transplant to ‘cure’ it. He denied that and said people on the internet talk “with so much confidence about what they don’t know.”\n\nBeyond talking about his own story, Adekunle Gold used the moment to push awareness. He told Nigerians to take genotype seriously before getting married, because two people with incompatible genotypes can pass sickle cell to their child and lock that child into a lifetime of pain. “Knowing your genotype is very important,” he said. “A lot of people still don’t understand the risks.”\n\n\nHe said he wants to “make more noise” about it, not just as a celebrity moment, but so fewer kids are born into a situation where every fever could become an emergency and every joint pain might mean another night in the hospital.\n\nFor him, this is personal — not PR. He’s lived it.",
